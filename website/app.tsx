      <h2>## BtcMirror is a Ethereum contract that tracks Bitcoin</h2>
      <p>
        This lets you prove that a BTC transaction executed, on Ethereum. In
        other words, it lets other Ethereum contracts run Simple Payment
        Verification (SPV) on BTC transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone can submit block headers to BtcMirror. The contract verifies
        proof-of-work, keeping only the longest chain it has seen. As long as
        50% of Bitcoin hash power is honest and at least one person is running
        the <a href="https://github.com/dcposch/btcmirror">submitter script</a>,
        the BtcMirror contract always reports the current canonical Bitcoin
        chain.
      </p>
      <h2>## Example applications</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>Payment for Ethereum-based assets in Bitcoin.</em> For example,
            you can deploy an ERC721 that will mint an NFT to anyone who can
            prove they've sent x BTC to y address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Trust-minimized BTC/ETH swaps.</em> Bob deploys an exchange
            contract and holds Bitcoin. To trade ETH to BTC, you first send ETH
            to the smart contract; by default, you can withdraw it again a day
            later. To keep the ETH, Bob posts a proof that he's sent you the
            corresponding amount of BTC. The opposite direction is even cleaner.
            You send Bitcoin to Bob's addesss, then submit a proof to the
            exchange contract to claim ETH.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Proof of burn.</em> You burn 1 BTC. You post proof to a
            contract, which lets you mint 1 BBTC (burnt Bitcoin) on Ethereum ðŸ˜ˆ
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Trust-minimized proof of reserve.</em> Currently, contracts like
            WBTC use oracles to prove their Bitcoin reserves. You could avoid
            trusted oracles using a balance-tracking contract. Anyone can submit
            SPV proofs of transactions to or from a given Bitcoin reserve
            address. The contract calls BtcMirror to verify the tx proofs and
            sums all transactions it's seen to track the current balance.
